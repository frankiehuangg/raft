## Background
Consensus protocols are essential in distributed systems to ensure coordination and reliability among multiple computers handling large-scale client requests. While optimizing a single computer with limited resources is challenging and often insufficient for ever-growing demands, distributed systems leverage many less powerful computers, allowing easy scalability and geographic distribution to serve clients globally. However, this approach introduces the need for effective coordination, which consensus protocols address by ensuring all connected computers agree on critical aspects like the Leader Node and transaction order. These protocols are fundamental to maintaining consistency and reliability in modern distributed systems, as seen in Kubernetes (etcd cluster), dqlite (Raft), and Apache Cassandra (Paxos), and are crucial for large-scale applications like YouTube to ensure eventual consistency and accurate ad revenue calculations.
